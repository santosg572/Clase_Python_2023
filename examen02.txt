4. Use IDLE to solve the following mathematical problems.
(a) A car runs at a constant speed of 20 km/h. When it passes another case, the
latter starts to accelerate in order to catch up. Assuming that the first case
keeps a constant speed, and the second car keeps a constant acceleration of
2 m/s 2 . After how many seconds will the second car catch up with the first
one?
(b) The annual interest rate of a savings account is 4.1 %. John has $10,000 in
his account, and aims at saving $50,000 within 5 years by depositing a fixed
amount of money to his account in the beginning of each year, including
this year. How much money does John need to save each year in order to
achieve his goal?
(c) In a shooting exercise, a coach stands 5 m away from a trainee, and throws
a target up vertically at 5 m/s. If the trainee must fire her gun exactly 0.5 s
after the throwing of the ball, then at which angle should she aim? If she
must fire the gun exactly 1 s after the throwing, then at which angle should
she aim?
(d) John deposited an initial sum of $3000 in his account. After 3 years, the
balance reaches $3335.8 due to composite interest. What is the interest rate
per annual?
